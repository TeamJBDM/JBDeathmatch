jbdm_v1.sp and jbdm_v1.smx

THESE ARE THE OLD PUBLIC RELEASES OF THE JBDM PLUGINS :)

jbdm_v1.1.sp and jbdm_v1.1.smx

The older version of JBDM Plugin, with support for dm_soccer.

jbdm_v1.2.sp and jbdm_v1.2.smx

but it made me cum a little it was so smooth

jbdm_v1.3.sp and jbdm_v1.3.smx and so forth

Older releases of JBDM, before/while stuff like physgun toggle and railgunmode was added. also multiplayer support! (prefix your map with jbdm_tp_ for this to work)

jbdm_v1.4.sp and jbdm_v1.4.smx

Physgun toggle, teamplay functionality, railgunmode, annabelle toggle, all the she-bang!

jbdm_v1.4.1.sp and jbdm_v1.4.1.smx
-JBDM's most updated version
Made the flaregun's projectiles do contact damage and ignite things on touch :) Currently the burntime is hardcoded, but you can customize the contact damage.
Added teamplay override.

The plugins jb_bhop, antikillbind, fnaflife, and jb_noblock are not used on any of the servers, and I should probably supply a server.cfg for server hosters to use at some point.
